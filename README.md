Udacity Project: Landing Page

The project is a simple landing page to showcase various concepts picked up throughout the course. 
It makes use of Javascript, CSS and HTML functions. The page is laid out in four sections and uses
Javascript to highlight the section that is 'in view'. It also required us to create a dynamic 
nav bar to scroll between sections. Again, the section 'in view' should be highlighted in the 
nav bar. 

Launching the project: 

Download the files and open the Index.html file.
